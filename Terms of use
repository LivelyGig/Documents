## Terms of Use


## The software you as an end user are about to use functions as a free, open source, and multi-signature digital wallet. The software does not constitute an account where LivelyGig or other third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of your bitcoin or ether or any other crypto currency.


## While the software has undergone beta testing and continues to be improved by feedback from the end users and others, we cannot guarantee that there will be no defects in the software. You acknowledge that your use of this software is at your own discretion and in compliance with all applicable laws. You are responsible for safekeeping your passwords, private key pairs, PINs and any other codes you use to access the software.


## **IF YOU LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR UBUNDA WALLET OR YOUR ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEYS AND YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF YOUR WALLET AND CORRESPONDING PASSWORD, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY BITCOIN OR ETHER OR ANY CRYTO CURRENCY YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT UBUNDA WALLET WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE. All transaction requests are irreversible. The authors of the software, employees and affiliates of LivelyGig, copyright holders, and LivelyGig, Inc. cannot retrieve your private keys or passwords if you lose or forget them and cannot guarantee transaction confirmation as they do not have control over the Bitcoin network.**

In no event shall the authors of the software, employees and affiliates of LivelyGig, copyright holders, or LivelyGig, Inc. be held liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software. We reserve the right to modify this disclaimer from time to time.**
